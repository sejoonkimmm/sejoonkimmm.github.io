# Next.js Deployment Guide: From Development to Production

Deploying a Next.js application can seem daunting, but with the right approach, it becomes straightforward. This guide covers everything from preparation to production.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying your Next.js app, ensure you have:

- ✅ Optimized images and assets
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Database connections secured
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Performance optimizations applied

## Deployment Options

### 1. Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy Next.js applications:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### 2. Netlify

For static sites and SSG applications:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```

### 3. Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Environment Variables

Always use environment variables for sensitive data:

```javascript
// .env.local
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret
```

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero image"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority
/>
```

### Code Splitting

Next.js automatically splits your code, but you can optimize further:

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/Heavy'));
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

Add monitoring to track your application's performance:

```jsx
// pages/_app.js
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <Analytics />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

1. Check for TypeScript errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure environment variables are set

### Runtime Errors

1. Check server logs
2. Verify API endpoints
3. Test database connections

## Conclusion

Deploying Next.js applications is straightforward with the right preparation. Start with Vercel for the easiest experience, then explore other options as your needs grow.
