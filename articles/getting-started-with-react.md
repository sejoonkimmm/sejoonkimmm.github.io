# Getting Started with React: A Beginner's Guide

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals and build your first component.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

## Key Concepts

### 1. Components
Components are the building blocks of React applications. They're like JavaScript functions that return JSX.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### 2. JSX
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that looks similar to HTML.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 3. Props
Props are how you pass data from parent to child components.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Sarah" />;
}
```

## Building Your First Component

Let's create a simple counter component:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about state management
- Explore React hooks
- Build a complete application

React makes it easy to create interactive UIs. Give it a try and start building amazing applications!
